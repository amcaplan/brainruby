# BrainRuby

Welcome to BrainRuby, the esoteric programming language which is basically just Ruby.

To compile, run the generator with 2 arguments:

1. The name of the file to compile
2. The name of the output file

For example:

``` sh
ruby generator.rb /path/to/some/file.rb /path/to/output/file.rb
```

That's it!  Have fun!
